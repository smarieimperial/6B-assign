// Assignment 6-B: Rainfall Statistics

// Author        : Stephanie Imperial

// Description   : Write a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of
// 12 months into an array of doubles. The program should calculate and display the total rainfall
// for the year, the average monthly rainfall, and the highest and lowest amounts of rain.
// INPUT VALIDATION: DO NOT ACCEPT NEGATIVE NUMBERS FOR MONTHLY RAINFALL FIGURES.

// Status      : Revised and completed

// *************************************************************************

  // Ask user to enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months into an array of doubles.
    // Calculate and display the total rainfall for the year.
    // Calculate and display the average monthly rainfall.
    // Display in inches the highest amount of rainfall. Display the month.
    // Display in inches the lowest amount of rainfall. Display the month.
    // Create input validation, do not accept negative numbers for monthly rainfall figures.
